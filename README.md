## ðŸ“š Built On Top Of

This project is based on the original *Deep Image Prior* by:

**Dmitry Ulyanov, Andrea Vedaldi, Victor Lempitsky**  
*CVPR 2018 â€“ Deep Image Prior*  
[arXiv:1711.10925](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10925)

It builds upon Deep Image Prior by incorporating a **multi-scale strategy** and introducing **architectural and optimisation modifications** tailored specifically for denoising tasks.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains the official code for my MAI dissertation project, which proposes a **Multi-Scale Deep Image Prior (MS-DIP)** framework for unsupervised image denoising. The core idea extends the original **Deep Image Prior (DIP)** method by incorporating:

- Multi-scale U-Net architectures
- Scale-adaptive Gaussian noise injection
- Output fusion across resolutions
- Custom loss functions including SSIM

MS-DIP aims to improve reconstruction of fine details **and** global structure, particularly under varying noise conditions.

## ðŸ“‚ Features

- Unsupervised training â€” no clean images required
- Fusion of multiple DIP models at different scales
- SSIM + MSE loss combination for perceptual and pixel accuracy
- Evaluation metrics: PSNR, SSIM with early stopping
- Supports Adamax, SGD, RMSProp, Adam optimisers
